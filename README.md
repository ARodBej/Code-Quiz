# Code-Quiz
For this challenge, we were tasked to make a quiz.

I was almost able to make it. I struggled to make the start quiz button work. When I console logged "hello", it would go through the code but wouldn't appear, so I got rid of the hide in the div then removed the child element and they appeared. Next challenge was to make the question buttons work but I was not able to make them function.The timer does not appear as well.

As you can also see, the score.js does not fully function as well and was not able to test it out fully as I never got to the end of my quiz.

I'll turn in what I have for now but I will make sure to go back to this in the future and fix the issues to make it fully functioning so I can add this to my portfolio.
